            Hi! My name is Amirhasan, but to make things easier for others, I go by Amir. I have masters degree in Mechanical Enginnering
            and have been working as a Manufactruing Engineer for the last 5 years. In my mind, however, I would like to
            think about myself as an Engineer. To me, Engineers are individuals who solve problems as tehy are presented
            to them. Regardless of the complexity or subject, an Engineer always welcome challenges and tries to explore
            options to solve them. When facing a challenge, an Engineer would ask: "how can I solve this?" in lieu of looking
            for reasons why it can't be done.
          </p>

          <p id="p2">
            I have been married for 5 years and just turned 30 last March! Personally, I enjoy being challenged and gain satisfaction
            in overcoming obstacles in life. 7 years ago, I decided to move to the US to pursue my academic and personal
            amibition. Since then, I have met new people, experienced new cultures and matured as a human being. For this,
            I'm always grateful for the decision I made.
          </p>
          <p id="p3">to learning more from Doug, Steve, and Sam, as well as all my cohort-mates. I do not expect the next 6 months to
            be easy, but I look at it as a foundation for a giant structure. If I can successfully build strong foundation,
            I could then use it to grow it to something amazing in my life. Because of this, I am rady to dedicate my time
            and energy to this cause for the next 6 months.
